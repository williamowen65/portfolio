I was inspired by front-end frameworks that provide the same thing, but in a much more restricted way. This solution provides a 100% customizable experience. This is still in maintenance at the moment, but it is very usable already.",

This product duplicates a template layout, including all of the hidden functionality, and creates a whole new spreadsheet which can be shared with clients, leaving the template to be reused. I used the Google App Script API to navigate manipulating the document and also added to the menu of the sheet. Follow my link to the medium article and you can set up with your own automated diary and learn about how it works."
