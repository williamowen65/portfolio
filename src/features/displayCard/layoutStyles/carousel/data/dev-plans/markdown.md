#### On My Web Development Horizon...

I am on the lookout for new and exciting
opportunities in the field with a bunch
of things still in my pocket that I want
to learn, machine learning among them.

I'll continue to grow a freelance
career. I aspire towards a goal where I
can offer "For $100, you can sit down
with me for an hour and walk away with
the website you wanted."

Starting a career and taking care of my
professional future has taken precedent
over the projects that first inspired me
to start learning. These projects float
in the horizon, but will soon see the
light of day!
