#### Life on the Sea

<p style="display: block">There is a magical place called the San Juan Islands that I always come back to. I'm not too worried about you finding my spots! It's honestly a gigantic sandbox to me, and I am an explorer.  </p>

<p style="display: inline">There's some 170 - 400 islands depending on how you count them and I memorized their layout, names, and waterways. I cleverly use the currents to just push me around. I even got to know various lifeforms that inhabit the area.

  It turns out the best way to experience awesome wonders is to spend way more time outside everyday. Guiding certainly provided that. So here's a little breakdown on some of my most awesome sightings...
</p>

- A full humpback breach! (happened out
  of no where...)
- A new born orca with 6-inch thick
  orange fur!
- A massive smack of glowing jellyfish
  washing up on the beach!
- Mangled remains of what I think was a
  giant octopus!
- Legitimate mirages that distort your
  vision!
- The entire range of orca encounters...
  breaching, spy-hopping, tail-slapping,
  playing, hunting, even sleeping (They
  move together "holding hands" in
  lines, while a mother sings to them to
  help them avoid obstacles).
